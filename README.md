Hello World! ðŸ‘‹ 

Welcome to my GitHub! Check out some of the projects that I have previously worked on or am currently working on!

Feel free to reach out to me through [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/dxiong1) or [email](mailto:dtx319+7@gmail.com). I also have all of my certifications listed on my LinkedIn profile and [Credly](https://credly.com/users/dtx319).

 After working a few years in sales at a Series B (at the time of hire) recruiting tech start-up called [Gem](https://www.gem.com/), I decided to shift my focus from 'selling a product' to 'creating a product.' I took a full-time 10-week full-stack web development bootcamp course with [Coding Temple](https://www.codingtemple.com/) in August 2022 and have been coding ever since: the continuous learning process is refreshing and exciting!
 
 I enjoy creating full-stack web applications using Python frameworks, JaveScript, CSS, React, and PostgreSQL. I am familiar with AWS Cloud concepts and am also curious about open source software, data science, machine learning, and AI.
