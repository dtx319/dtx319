Hello World! 👋 My name is Dennis.

Welcome to my GitHub! Feel free to browse some of the projects that I've been or am currently working on.

Feel free to reach out to me via [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/dxiong1) or [email](mailto:dtx319+7@gmail.com). I also have a profile on [Credly](https://credly.com/users/dtx319).

 After working a few years in sales at a Series B (at the time of hire) recruiting tech start-up called [Gem](https://www.gem.com/), I decided to shift my focus from 'selling a product' to 'creating a product.' I took a full-stack web development boot camp course with [Coding Temple](https://www.codingtemple.com/) and have been coding ever since! 
 
 I enjoy creating full-stack web applications using Python frameworks, JaveScript, CSS, React, and PostgreSQL. I am also curious about open source software, data science, machine learning, and AI.
